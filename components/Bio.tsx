			<p>
				Back in 2013, I started my journey as a graphic designer, but soon found
				myself immersed in the world of web development. Since then, I've had
				the privilege of working with a wide variety of clients across
				industries like real estate, airlines, telecommunications, and
				marketing, helping them create everything from sleek websites to
				complete branding packages.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Today, my focus is on building engaging web experiences that blend
				beautiful design with solid engineering, whether it's a custom app or a
				full-fledged e-commerce platform. I love tackling new challenges that
				push the boundaries of both creativity and technology.

				When I'm not coding, you can find me behind a camera lens exploring
				photography, strumming my acoustic guitar, or geeking out over all
				things Star Wars.
